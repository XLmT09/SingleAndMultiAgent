# Final Year Project

## Important

To have all functionality from using the application to testing it you must be within the product directory NOT the root directory of this repository.

So remember to <code>cd project</code> before starting!!

## Testing

To run every test you can do the following command:\
<code>python -m unittest discover ./testing/</code>

To run specific test files, do the following:\
<code>python -m unittest .\testing\\<test_file></code>

This repository has been created to store your final year project.

You may edit it as you like, but please do not remove the default topics or the project members list. These need to stay as currently defined in order for your supervisor to be able to find your project.
