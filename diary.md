Week 1

I have been doing research for the project and making a rough plan of what I will be doing this year.


Week 2

- I have created the maze for the game, adding different tile types.
- Added charcter animations and movement.
- Add collison detection with the chaaracter and the maze.
- Add diamond into the game, when the character collides with the diamond the game will pause.
